# Welcome!

This page has been created for collaboration of BCA students.
We intend to share important links, tips and study aids through this page.

To make editing easier, we use the markdown language, which is very simple to learn.
All you need to do is create text files with the specified syntax and publish it. 
Github Pages will automatically convert your text into properly formated HTML.
here is a document that will help you learn [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
